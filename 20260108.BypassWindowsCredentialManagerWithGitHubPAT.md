# Option 3: Quick Summary

Final Solution:

-1 Create GitHub PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens (scope: repo)

-2 Run: git remote set-url origin https://wn00136364_wdp:YOUR_PAT@github.com/witglobal/wpxitops-entraid-automations.git

-3 Test: git fetch origin and git pull

> Other devices:

- Test the remotes that are available for the repo: `git remote -v`

- You must add a remote with the PAT:
`git remote add origin https://wn00136364_wdp:XXX@github.com/witglobal/wpxitops-powerplatform-automations.git`

- If there are already remotes rather than adding one iy is possible to reset:
`git remote set-url origin https://wn00136364_wdp:XXX@github.com/witglobal/wpxitops-powerplatform-automations.git`
